Spell can have a "trait" and the spell can also confer a trait to the
target as an enchantment.

enchantment can:
 confers a defense which may or may not be unaffected by conditions on the creature
 alter the number of attack dice for certain types of attacks (e.g. agony)
 grant a trait (fast)
 grant a trait with a modifier (e.g., melee +2)
 enchantment may have a reveal trigger
 grant life
 cause an effect when the creature moves (chains of agony damages the creature)
 have different reveal conditions (charm can only be revealed between
	 action phases)
 prevent the target from attacking the controller
 provide conditions for the destruction of the enchantment
 	(charm = on damage from controller)
 have variable reveal cost
 teleport creature,
 confer traits to a target's attacks of a certain type (melee or ranged)
 may be ineffective against creatures with certain traits
 damage the target during upkeep
 restrain a creature

forcefield - special case
confer armor to all friendly corporeal creatures in the target zone
marked for death

reveal cost:
	creature's level - 1
	2 * creature's level

Enchantments are cast on a specific target. They do not exert their
effects until they are revealed, after the caster has paid a reveal
cost. The possible effects of enchantments are many and must be taken
into account during various game stages and actions.

It may make sense to move life/armor/channeling to the "Card" class
